# Question 1
# Every named entity in Ruby has an object_id. This is a unique identifier for that object.

# It is often the case that two different things "look the same", but they can be different objects. The "under the hood" object referred to by a particular named-variable can change depending on what is done to that named-variable.

# In other words, in Ruby, all values are objects...but they are not always the same object.

# Predict how the values and object ids will change throughout the flow of the code below:

# Question 3
# Let's call a method, and pass both a string and an array as parameters and see how even though they are treated in the same way by Ruby, the results can be different.

# Study the following code and state what will be displayed...and why:

def tricky_method(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param += "rutabaga" # Reassignment within method, nothing happens outside. 
  an_array_param << "rutabaga" # Mutation within method
end

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}" # Pumpkins > Not mutated. += is a reassignment, not a mutation.
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}" # [pumpkins, rutabaga] due to mutation to the object id

# Question 4
# To drive that last one home...let's turn the tables and have the string show a modified output, 
# while the array thwarts the method's efforts to modify the caller's version of it.

def tricky_method_two(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param << 'rutabaga' # Mutation method << 
  an_array_param = ['pumpkins', 'rutabaga'] # Assignment method = 
end

my_array = ["pumpkins"]

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}" # String is mutated, pumpkinsrutabaga
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}" # Array is not mutated, should be pumpkins

# Question 5
# Depending on a method to modify its arguments can be tricky:

def tricky_method(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param += "rutabaga"
  an_array_param += ["rutabaga"]
  return a_string_param, an_array_param
